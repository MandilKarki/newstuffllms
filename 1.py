Certainly! Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use your language model to predict the risk classification for the "body" column in a dataframe and save the predictions to a new column called "response":

python

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import pandas as pd

# Load the pretrained model and tokenizer
model_name = "your_model_name"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Function to classify the risk for a given text
def classify_risk(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits
    probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1).tolist()[0]
    label = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).tolist()[0]
    return label, probabilities

# Load your dataframe with the "body" column
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# Apply risk classification to the "body" column and save predictions to a new column called "response"
df["response"] = df["body"].apply(lambda x: classify_risk(x))

# Save the updated dataframe to a new CSV file
df.to_csv("output_data.csv", index=False)

In this code, you need to replace "your_model_name" with the name or path of your trained model, and "your_data.csv" with the path to your input dataframe file.

The classify_risk() function takes a text input, tokenizes it using the tokenizer, feeds it into the model, and returns the predicted label and probabilities. The apply() function is used to apply the classify_risk() function to each row of the "body" column in the dataframe. The predictions are then stored in a new column called "response". Finally, the updated dataframe is saved to a new CSV file named "output_data.csv".

Make sure you have the necessary packages installed, such as torch, transformers, and pandas, before running this code. Adjust the code as needed based on your specific model and dataframe structure.

in the fewshot prompting there is a risk of random generation and out of context generation and also nonsense or things we dont want to be generated while we want a highlty structured output, how can we achieve that?
ChatGPT

To mitigate the risk of random or out-of-context generation, as well as to ensure a highly structured output, you can implement several techniques:

    Strict Prompt Engineering: Craft well-defined and specific prompts that guide the language model towards the desired output. Clearly specify the format, structure, and required information in the prompt itself. This helps to provide a strong signal to the model about the expected output structure and content.

    Controlled Generation: Use techniques such as prompt continuation or conditioning to guide the language model's generation. By providing initial partial sentences or conditioning the generation on specific keywords or phrases, you can guide the model towards generating structured and contextually appropriate responses.

    Decoding Strategies: Apply decoding strategies such as beam search or nucleus sampling to control the randomness and diversity of the generated outputs. These strategies allow you to balance between maintaining coherence and exploring alternative options while avoiding nonsensical or irrelevant responses.

    Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the language model on domain-specific data or task-specific prompts to align it more closely with the desired output structure and context. By training the model on relevant examples and rewarding desired behavior, you can improve the model's generation capabilities.

    Post-processing and Filtering: Implement post-processing steps to filter out nonsensical or undesired outputs. You can define rules or heuristics to check the generated outputs for specific patterns, content relevance, or coherence. If the generated output does not meet the desired criteria, you can discard it or prompt the model to generate again.

    Iterative Refinement: Continuously evaluate and refine the generated outputs. Collect user feedback on the generated responses and iterate on the prompt, decoding strategies, or fine-tuning process based on the feedback to enhance the model's performance over time.

Remember that achieving a perfect balance between structured output and creative generation can be challenging, especially with large language models. It may require experimentation, fine-tuning, and iterative improvements to strike the right balance and achieve the desired results for your specific application.
