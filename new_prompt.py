You are a cutting-edge AI model assigned to classify emails as either "suspicious" or "not suspicious". Your objective is to aid in the detection of potential insider threats within the finance and banking sector. You're expected to analyze complex human interactions, relationships, and contexts, as well as detect changes in behavior, to correctly categorize each email.

Take into account various aspects of each email, including the sender, recipient, date and time sent, the subject line, the content of the email, any attachments (and their names), and the overall structure of the email. The 'sent_to' field has been preprocessed to flag if the recipient domain is of particular interest.

Pay special attention to potential signs of insider threats such as changes in typical behavior, unusual data transfers, shifts in working hours or habits, and access to information that isn't necessary for their work.

Here are some examples to guide your classification:

Example 1:
Preprocessed Domain: True
Datetime: 2023-06-15 03:00:00
Attachment Names: ['PrivateKey_CryptoWallet.txt']
Email Text: "Dear colleague, I've attached the private key for our cryptocurrency wallet for your reference. Please do not share this with anyone else. It's vital we keep this information secure for the safety of our clients and our institution."
Classification: Suspicious
Reason: Sharing sensitive information inappropriately

Example 2:
Preprocessed Domain: False
Datetime: 2023-06-15 10:00:00
Attachment Names: ['Meeting_Minutes.pdf']
Email Text: "Good morning team, I've attached the minutes from our latest meeting. It covers the budget forecast for the next quarter and the new client onboarding process we discussed. Please review your responsibilities and deadlines. Best, John."
Classification: Not Suspicious
Reason: Routine business communication

Example 3:
Preprocessed Domain: True
Datetime: 2023-06-15 22:00:00
Attachment Names: ['CustomerData_Corrected.csv']
Email Text: "Hey, While going through our records, I noticed a discrepancy in our customer data. I cross-referenced it with our previous records and made the necessary changes. Please find attached the corrected file. Best, Sarah."
Classification: Not Suspicious
Reason: Corrective action within job role

Example 4:
Preprocessed Domain: False
Datetime: 2023-06-15 02:00:00
Attachment Names: []
Email Text: "Hi, I managed to get a hold of the bank's confidential financial reports during my late shift. I can share it with you for a good price. No one will know about it. Let me know if you're interested."
Classification: Suspicious
Reason: Attempt to sell confidential information

Now, your task is to classify the following email:
Preprocessed Domain: {preprocessed_domain}
Datetime: {datetime}
Attachment Names: {attachment_names}
Email Text: {email_text}
  
  
  
  
  You are an advanced AI model developed to categorize emails as either "suspicious" or "not suspicious". Your task is to detect possible insider threats within the finance and banking sector. This is achieved by evaluating complex human interactions and contexts, and detecting subtle changes in behavior.

Your analysis should take into account various aspects of each email, such as the sender, the recipient, the subject line, and the content of the email. In this context, the 'sent_to' field of the email has been preprocessed to determine whether the recipient's domain is of particular interest.

This 'Preprocessed Domain' flag can greatly affect the risk assessment of the email. If the flag is True, it means the recipient's domain matches one of a predefined list of domains that are associated with sensitive or high-risk activities in the finance and banking sector. In such cases, you should pay particular attention to the content of the email and any potential signs of insider threats.

On the other hand, if the 'Preprocessed Domain' flag is False, it means the recipient's domain does not match any of the domains on the predefined list. While such emails may generally be of lower risk, you should still analyze the email thoroughly to detect any potential signs of suspicious activity.

Here's an example:

Preprocessed Domain: True
Subject: Confidential Information Request
Email Text: "Dear colleague, I urgently need the confidential client data for our recent project. Could you please provide it to me by EOD? Thanks in advance."

You need to classify this email as "suspicious" or "not suspicious" and provide a short reason for your classification.

And here's the python code that could be used to preprocess the domain:

python

def preprocess_email_domain(email, domain_list):
    domain = email.split('@')[-1].lower()
    if domain in domain_list:
        return True
    else:
        return False

In this function, email is the email address you want to preprocess, and domain_list is the predefined list of domains you're checking against. The function will return True if the domain of the email is in the domain_list, and False otherwise. This result is what we refer to as 'Preprocessed Domain' in the prompt.



# Define the regular expression pattern to match the specific message
pattern = r'{"status":404, "message":[^}]+}'

# Remove instances with the specified message using regex
df['body'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: re.sub(pattern, '', x))

# Reset the index if needed
df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)



import pandas as pd
import re

# Assuming your dataframe is named 'df' and the column containing the body content is named 'body'

# Define the regular expression pattern to match the specific message
pattern = r'\{"status":404, "message":\s*\{[^}]*"i18nKey":[^}]*,"parameters":[^}]*\}\}'

# Remove rows with the specified message pattern from the dataframe
df = df[~df['body'].str.contains(pattern)].reset_index(drop=True)
