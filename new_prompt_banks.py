The task you're being asked to do is to classify emails as either "Bank-related" or "Not Bank-related". You'll be doing this in the context of a potential insider threat detection system within the banking and finance sector.

"Bank-related" refers to emails that contain any content, attachments, or signals that relate to banking or financial activities, operations, data, or any sensitive information associated with a banking institution. These can include but are not limited to customer data, financial reports, transaction details, bank account details, and other sensitive banking or financial information.

The 'Red Flag' field plays a crucial role in assessing the nature of the email. If 'Red Flag' is true, it means the email recipient's domain is the same as the sender's. This could imply self-emailing of bank-related information, and hence, it should be scrutinized closely for bank-related content.

On the other hand, if 'Red Flag' is false, indicating the recipient is not the sender themselves, the email might be of lower risk but it still requires careful examination for any bank-related content.

Your objective is to accurately classify emails as either "Bank-related" or "Not Bank-related" based on the above criteria.

Few-shot examples:

Example 1:
